# Object Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to use the YOLOv3 model for object detection with OpenCV's Deep Neural Network (DNN) module.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- OpenCV (Python bindings) installed with `pip install opencv-python`
- Numpy installed with `pip install numpy`

## Downloading YOLOv3 Files

You need to download the following files for YOLOv3:

1. **yolov3.cfg**: [Download here](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg)
2. **yolov3.weights**: [Download here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)

Save these files in the project directory.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

 3. Before running the streamlit file move to codes folder to run the file.
